											<h3 class="major">Automated Flight Ticket Scraper & Notification System</h3>
											<p>I developed a web platform that automates the process of scraping airline ticket data and filtering results based on predefined criteria. The system integrates a web crawler and scraper, extracts flight information, and automatically sends notifications via WhatsApp and Telegram. Additionally, it features a real-time progress tracker for both data extraction and message dispatch.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Netshoes Web Scraper</h3>
											<p>This project involved the development of a web crawler and scraper in JavaScript, using Puppeteer to extract footwear data (such as product names, prices, descriptions, and ratings) from the Netshoes website. The scraper navigates through the site, collects structured data, and stores it in a JSON file for further analysis. This project demonstrates my skills in web scraping, data extraction, and automation, as well as my ability to handle challenges like dynamic content and website structure changes.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Credit Card Registration System</h3>
											<p>This project was developed as a 4th-semester college assignment. It is a credit card registration and management system built in Java with a MySQL database connection. The system allows users to register, view, edit, and delete credit card information, as well as validate data such as card numbers and expiration dates. It demonstrates my skills in Java programming, database management, and data validation techniques.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Sorting Algorithms Implementation in Python</h3>
											<p>This project involved the implementation of three fundamental sorting algorithms in Python: Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm was developed from scratch to demonstrate a deep understanding of their logic, time complexity, and efficiency. The project highlights my ability to work with data structures, optimize code, and analyze algorithmic performance. It serves as a practical example of my problem-solving skills and proficiency in Python programming.</p>
